## The Carpentries Executive Council

### Introduction

The Carpentries Executive Council is the highest leadership body of The Carpentries, to whom the Executive Director of 
the Carpentries reports. The Council comprises nine members - four elected by the community and five appointed by the Executive Council. 

The Executive Council is responsible for strategic and organisational planning, selecting the Executive Director and evaluating their performance, financial oversight, identifying revenue streams and resource development, approving and monitoring The Carpentries programs and services, and enhancing The Carpentries public image. Members of the Council also serve as advocates and ambassadors for the organisation, leveraging their networks to benefit the organization’s reputation and fundraising. The Executive Council executes these responsibilities through a combination of monthly Executive Council meetings and regular correspondence and collaboration via email and online platforms. For the full description of the Executive Council’s roles and responsibilities, see the Executive Council section of the [Carpentries Bylaws](bylaws.html#executive-council). 

In addition to [publicly posting meeting minutes](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/tree/master/minutes), the Executive Council reports on its activities periodically in [Carpentry Clippings](https://carpentries.org/newsletter/) (the organizational newsletter) as well as through [blog posts](https://carpentries.org/posts-by-tags/#blog-tag-governance).
The council also prepares [Yearly Summaries](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/tree/master/year-in-review) of its activities.

### Executive Council's Standing Committees
As of January 2021, the following standing committee structure was implemented as a practical way to manage the work and engagement of the Executive Council:

- [Officers Committee](#officers-committee)
- [Governance Committee](#governance-committee)
- [Finance Committee](#finance-committee)
- [Communications Committee](#communications-committee)
- [Program Committee](#program-committee)

Serving on a specific standing committee provides Executive Council members with the opportunity to bring their subject matter expertise to specific governance and operational priorities, deal with issues and projects more effectively and efficiently, and maximize time and resources between meetings. Each Executive Council member serves on at least one, but no more than two committees. When considered beneficial or necessary, these committees can have members from The Carpentries community and/or Core Team.

In addition to the Standing committees, the Executive council may appoint Ad hoc committees to handle issues that are typically short-term and specialized in nature.

#### Officers Committee
This committee consists of the Executive Council Officers: Chair, Vice Chair, Secretary and Treasurer.

**Roles & Responsibilities**
- Act with full authority of the Executive Council between EC meetings when needed in urgent matters, subject to Executive Council imposed limitations on committee action
Prioritize the agenda of the Executive Council meetings
- Monitor the performance of the Executive Director, conduct their annual performance review, and make recommendations to the Executive Council regarding the Executive Director’s performance goals for the subsequent year
- Provide a sounding board to the Executive Director and serve as a source of ready advice on operating and personnel matters
- Obtain and evaluate relevant compensation information and make a recommendation to the Executive Council regarding the Executive Director’s compensation (including all benefits)
- Provide support to the Executive Director and direction to the Executive Council on oversight of legal and operational issues
- Lead Executive Council level oversight of the organization's long-term strategic plan and short-term annual planning, including annual review of strategic plan performance metrics against anticipated community end results (outcomes).

Executive Council officers are selected at the first regular meeting following election and appointment of new members and serve one year terms.

but sometimes we need to choose to withhold information from others.

#### Responsibilities of all Executive Council Members

The [Carpentries Bylaws](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html#executive-council)
describe the formal responsibilities of the Executive Council from an
organisational level. This text describes the current implementation of the tasks described in the bylaws and represents
flexible guidelines that may be adapted as the Executive Council deems necessary. In addition to documenting Executive Council standard operating
procedures, it is also intended to clarify Executive Council function for the broader community and help potential members understand the
commitment to serve on the Executive Council.

In practice, each Executive Council member is responsible for the following general tasks:

* Supporting the Mission and Vision of The Carpentries
* Exemplifying the Code of Conduct
* Ensuring The Carpentries’ adherence to legal agreements and standards
* Offering their expertise to help ensure the health and success of the organization
* Actively participating in discussions about strategic and financial decisions
* Providing feedback and voting on formal motions within one week of their posting
* Attending (in person or by phone/web-based) at least 75% of the meetings held each year
* Dedicating at least three volunteer hours per week toward Carpentries activities (including meeting attendance)

The specific commitments expected of Executive Council members include monthly meetings (1-1.5 hours, online) and a once-yearly
face-to-face meeting (expenses covered by The Carpentries). Minutes for these meetings are published to [a GitHub repository](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/tree/master/minutes) after
approval by Executive Council members. We may periodically schedule additional virtual meetings to address particular topics. Officers and Executive Council
liaisons to Committees or Task Forces may have additional commitments for meetings. Asynchronous commitments involve suggesting
agenda items for meetings, responding to email requests for opinions, and formal voting on resolutions (as issues in this
repository), and work resulting from being on a task force or committee representing the Executive Council.

### Communication

We use two mailing lists:

* [executive-council@carpentries.org](mailto:executive-council@carpentries.org): this is an internal list, and includes Executive Council and Executive Director; this list can only receive messages from list members
* [carpentries-executive-council@carpentries.org](mailto:carpentries-executive-council@carpentries.org): recipients are Executive Council Chair and Vice Chair; anyone can send to this, allowing the community to communicate directly with the Executive Council (but not the rest of our community)

### Meetings

The Executive Council generally meets once monthly (we are required to hold at least 10 meetings a year, either in person or online). Smaller groups of Executive Council members may hold additional meetings when needed.

- [Publicly available meeting minutes](https://github.com/carpentries/executive-council-info/tree/master/minutes)

- Scheduling is done through our Google calendar<sup>*</sup>
- Executive Council members are invited to attend the Core Team meetings whenever they desire

### Finances and Fiscal Sponsor
