## Community Sessions

The Carpentries Community Development Team leads and organises Community Sessions. This document describes how community sessions are organised and conducted.  Checklists for the Session Hosts are [here](#checklists-community-discussions).  

The Carpentries Community Sessions are designed for everyone in The Carpentries community interested in learning, educating and advocating for teaching foundational coding and data science skills globally. Session topics range anywhere from teaching workshops and developing curricula to building local communities and assessing the impact of our workshops globally. There are three types of Community Sessions:

1. __Community Discussion Session__ structured (e.g., panel discussion with Q&A) or flexibly structured session (e.g., networking session) on any topic relevant to the community that can be in any format of the hostâ€™s choosing

2. __Skill-up Session__ session offering a professional development opportunity for the community where hosts teach relevant skills

3. __Collaboration Session__ session providing dedicated time and space to co-develop a community resource or to co-work on any community activity

### Who Can Host?

Hosting community sessions is a great way to meet more people in The Carpentries community, to get to know the organisation better, to learn from the experiences of others and to share your own knowledge and experience with an even greater number of people.

Any member of The Carpentries community is welcome to host a community sessions. Sessions are coordinated by The Carpentries Community Development Team. To receive messages relating to sessions and hosting, make sure that you are subscribed to the [session hosts mailing list](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discussion-hosts).

A great way to get into hosting these sessions is to first attend as an observer or co-host. An experienced host will be happy to talk you through it, and may return the favour when you host for the first time.


#### Session Host Onboarding

### Scheduling Community Sessions

With the exception of some sessions led by our subcommunities, community sessions are scheduled on a quarterly basis [as described here](../communications/guides/community_events.md). This allows The Carpentries Community Development Team to support your recruitment initiatives and help publicise your event. In the rare instance that you need to schedule such sessions outside of a quarter, please contact the team. Your session is not confirmed until you hear from a member of The Carpentries Community Development Team.

If you are interested in adding a session for your subcommunity to the Etherpad and having it added to the Community Calendar, please email community@carpentries.org.

### Expectations and Checklists

#### Host Expectations

* While it's the co-host's main responsibility to take notes, please take notes in the Etherpad when the co-host/notetaker is speaking.
* Maintain focus on the main goal of the session, which is to share ideas, support each other, and keep instructors excited about teaching.
* Ensure instructors teaching in the near future have urgent questions or concerns addressed.
* Collect feedback from Instructors who have recently taught.
* Engage newly trained Instructors and evaluating their participation using a subset of questions described in the [checkout procedure](https://carpentries.github.io/instructor-training/checkout/).
* Encourage attendees to create issues or pull requests to correct problems.
* Complete the [host questionnaire](https://forms.gle/KRnkXhqWQh6BLc9Z8) at the end of the community discussion.

#### Checklists - Community Sessions

Community sessions are organised and conducted through [the community session Etherpad](http://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions). Many regional subcommunities use their own notetaking platform. Links to these can be found at the top of the Community Discussions Etherpad and are available in the relevant event on our Community Calendar.

##### Before the Discussion Session 

- Sign on as close to the start time as you can.  
- Confirm that your fellow host is present (if there is one) and who will be leading/taking notes
- (Optional) If a group is very large and you have a co-host, you can split the group in two, using the [Breakout Rooms feature in Zoom](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/tools/zoom_rooms.html#information-for-event-hosts).
- Copy the agenda from the bottom of the Etherpad to the space under your time slot
- Lead the discussion
    - We recommend following the main points of the agenda, but feel free to let discussion go where people want.  Not all the questions need to be answered by everyone.  
    - You should not feel like *you* have to answer all the questions as the host - draw on the
    other discussion participants to answer each other's questions.  
    - If someone is attending as part of their training checkout, prompt them to ask a question.
    - Try to leave enough time at the end for the final agenda item.  

##### During the Discussion Session 

You can follow the agenda below to guide a pre-post workshop discussion session. This and additional agenda templates can be found at the botom of the Community Discussions Etherpad. 

- Welcome, introductions, and reminder of Code of Conduct (5-10 minutes depending on number of participants)   
  - Code of Conduct Link: [https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html)

  - Any changes or additions to lesson material?  
- Preparing for upcoming workshops (10 minutes)
  - Specific questions about teaching and/or lessons?
  - How are instructors sharing roles/responsibilities?  Is there a designated "lead instructor" or will you act as co-instructors?
- Discussion Questions [Use Zoom Breakout Rooms for large groups](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/tools/zoom_rooms.html#information-for-event-hosts) (15 minutes)
  - Hosts: Choose 1-3 of these questions, or add your own.
  - What additional resources would be useful to you in teaching or preparing for a workshop?
  - Do you find the instructor notes helpful? How do you use them? How could they be more useful?
  - What are you most excited about for teaching with The Carpentries?
- Preparing for instructor training checkout (2 minutes)

  - Thank attendees for participating

Based on discussion among the Instructor Development Committee, temporary questions may be added to the agenda for a month of sessions, in order to collect data on specific issues.  

- Take notes

> If there are more than 5 workshops represented by attendees, the discussion session should be split into two groups, to make sure everyone has enough time to share.  When dividing attendees into two groups, try to balance the number of people who are de-briefing, who are there for pre-workshop help, and who are instructor trainees.  If there are exactly 5 workshops represented, it is at the discretion of the host whether to split the group.  

##### After the Discussion Session
- Archive the Etherpad by clicking on the star in the top right corner.  
- Fill out the [host questionnaire](https://forms.gle/N74pFuGkRLawpCHh7)
    - Note: Please copy the list of attendees (including all attendees but removing no-shows) and paste it into question 7 of the questionnaire.
    - This questionnaire will automatically send an email to the Instructor Development Committee Co-Chairs and to instructor.training@carpentries.org.
- Clear the information from your session (date/time, attendees, notes) from the Etherpad.
- (Optional) write a [blog post](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/submit_blog_post.html#how-to-contribute-a-blog-post-to-the-carpentries-blog) about interesting points that came up in discussion.

### Discussion Session FAQ

The content below comes from [this blog post](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/05/community-discussions-primer/).

##### What if I am hosting a discussion and there are no pre/post workshop debriefs?

You could start by introducing the session and what it should be about. You could also give some feedback on your own experience in previous workshops and/or upcoming workshops that you are a part of.

##### What if I do not know the answer to someone's questions and no one in the room does either?

It is totally fine if you do not know all the answers. In such a situation you are welcome to refer the question to someone within The Carpentries community that will have the answer. If not, you could always send your question to [community@carpentries.org](mailto:community@carpentries.org).

##### What if the host/co-host has a poor internet connection and is unable to communicate? What if Zoom fails to work (e.g. your internet connection fails?)

It is very important to test your internet connection beforehand and to make sure that you as a host are able to communicate. The host is the session leader and should have a stable connection. If, however, when you test your connection you find that you do not have a good connection, reach out to the community to see if someone could take over as host for that session. Do this by sending a message to [discussion-hosts on TopicBox](https://carpentries.topicbox.com/groups/discussion-hosts).

##### What if a group from a single site has connectivity issues?

You could ask them to try and reconnect. However if they continue to have issues and cannot participate in the session, please ask them to reschedule.

##### What if no one shows up?

If no one shows up simply wait for a few minutes, send out reminder emails to the signed up participants, and then fill in the post discussion questionnaire and indicate that no one showed up for your session.

##### What if someone talks too much?

Limit the amount of time that you give participants to ask and answer questions. You could ask for feedback from someone who has not spoken yet as well.

##### What if there is no co-host/note taker and the session is fully booked?

As a host you are more than welcome to take a few notes, however there is no need to take down every single thing that is said. Note down important points, making sure to add links to useful information. Also encourage the participants to contribute to the notes on the [Community Discussions Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/community-discussions).

##### What if someone joins in late?

Depending on how late the person joins, you could simply welcome them and ask them to introduce themselves to the rest of the participants. If you have time, you can ask the individual to stay on the call for a few minutes after it is finished to summarise what they missed, and answer any questions they may have.

##### What if someone does not have a headset and canâ€™t control their background noise?

As a host you will have the privileges to mute other participants, or you could simply ask the person directly to mute their microphone.  Read more about how to use [host features in Zoom](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/tools/zoom_rooms.html#information-for-event-hosts).

##### What if I forget to complete the host questionnaire?

The participants will not have updated profiles for the checkout sessions and it will take a lot of administration to solve this challenge. Please remember to fill in the form directly after hosting your session.

##### What if someone breaks the Code of Conduct? What if someone had a report of misconduct?

In the case that this happens The Carpentries has a set of [guidelines](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/incident-response.html) that can be followed.

##### What if one person doesnâ€™t contribute to the conversation?

Always try and encourage participation. This can be done by asking them a question or asking them their thoughts on a specific topic of conversation. There is also a point in the agenda that allows you as the host to talk to participants and ask them each for a specific question that they need answering.

##### What if someone asks me to join the instructor checkout session and it is already full?

Participants can email the host and ask if it would be ok with them if they joined the session although it is already fully booked.

##### What if someone is loud/obnoxious and/or talks down to other people?

It is very important to remind everyone of the [Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/index_coc.html) as The Carpentries observes it in every community discussion. This will be a clear violation of this and you could ask the person to leave.

##### What if I am having trouble understanding one of the attendees?

You could ask the participant to type their questions in the Community Discussions Etherpad for you to read and respond to them, which will also make note taking much easier. Consider asking them to speak up if the microphone is too soft.
